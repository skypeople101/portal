          I am barely sad these days and it is a good thing. It is a good thing that I wake up in the morning and you are not the first thought I have. You are no longer the pain I cannot bear to carry. You are no longer the loss that left me empty. I am happier, lighter, stronger.

and yet…

Not even because I’ve finally found who I’m supposed to be and that I picked up the pieces of myself that you shattered. I’m ok now because I accept that it won’t ever be easy, the not-having-you part. I accept that there will always be a hollow space inside of me where you used to be. I’m accepting it. All of it. You’re gone. And no matter how much I convince myself that I forgot you, I won’t, not really. Because you will always be a part of me. And I’m finally fine with that.”</p>

          The way your eyes wrinkle at the edges when you found something I said amusing, which was almost always. The way your lips often found their way on mine, soft and comforting. The way you looked in bed at 3ams, legs draped in mine, your breath on my cheek, your forehead on mine. Your silly jokes and your cheeky smile. The look on your face every time you said I was beautiful. The safeness I felt every time you were around.

          Your 20s is the time for you to find out who you really are, what you really love, what you really want to end up doing for the rest of your life. Now is the time to risk things, experiment, explore.

That is the beauty of it, the challenge of it; to remain true to yourself, to your passions, and to your dreams despite all the bumps along the road. So celebrate your 20s. Make the most of it. Be who you are, no apologies. You don’t want to wake up, 57 and white-haired and wrinkled, regretting that you did not do all the things you wanted to.”
